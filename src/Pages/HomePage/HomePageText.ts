    Welcome to my Porfolio page. 

    I'm Alucard, I'm a software engineer with 8 year of working experience. 

    I currently work on a major project in one of the FANG companies. 

    I'm going to keep this as short as possible, I love to code, for fun and professionally.
    My father, Mark Henry was my inspiration, he would leave books in C or SQL laying around the home...
    I was always totally entranced with the strange symbols and elegance... Later I fell more in love with 
    Design Patterns, Algorithms, Coding problems and Software in genral.
